# üõ°Ô∏è Windows Detection Lab ‚Äì Offensive Simulation & Defensive Logging
A self-contained cybersecurity lab simulating real-world attacker behavior against a Windows 10 virtual machine, with live telemetry and detection mechanisms configured to monitor malicious activity. Built using Kali Linux and VirtualBox, this project demonstrates practical blue team visibility aligned with MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

# üöÄ Objective
Design and deploy a local detection lab that allows experimentation with attacker techniques, visibility tooling, and security event logging‚Äîwithout relying on enterprise infrastructure or cloud-based solutions.

# üß± Lab Architecture
| Component      | Role                         | Key Capabilities                               |
|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Windows VM     | Target system                | Sysmon, Defender, PowerShell logging           |
| Kali Linux VM  | Attacker / simulation box    | Recon tools (`nmap`, `enum4linux`, `base64`)   |
| VirtualBox     | VM orchestration layer       | Hosts both machines with internal networking   |

Windows Configuration:

1. Non-admin test user (labuser)
2. Sysmon (64-bit) installed with advanced config
3. PowerShell ScriptBlock + Module Logging via Registry
4. Defender active and updated
5. Verified logs in Event Viewer (4103, 4104)

Kali Linux:
1. Tools used: nmap, enum4linux, base64, msfconsole
2. Internal networking (host-only) for VM interaction

# üîç Detection Capabilities

‚úÖ Logged:
1. Encoded PowerShell commands
2. Module invocation events
3. ScriptBlock executions
4. Defender threat alerts
5. Sysmon process and network telemetry

üîú Upcoming Simulations:
1. MITRE Techniques: T1059, T1047, T1086
2. Reverse shell payloads
3. Port scans and Windows service enumeration
